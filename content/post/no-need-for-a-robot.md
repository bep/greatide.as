**A Norwegian company has invented a robot to drill holes in the ceiling. A reduction in work-related injuries is supposed to be one of the big wins. A tip for those who cannot afford one: Use your strong legs to do the heavy lifting!**

And maybe add some low-tech pneumatics[^pneumatics] or hydraulics[^hydraulics] to help.

In the video below nLink[^nlink] demonstrates a robot doing what mankind are doing manually today. The speed of the robot is hard to beat, but the bodily harms should be easily reduced even when doing the old-style manual labour.[^manual]

In another video they show a *man vs robot in ceiling-drilling competition*, drilling a number of holes every 30 centimeters in a straight line. A video highly inspired by Top Gear. The robot wins of course, with a 5 times speedup -- but the human does his job painstakingly ineffective, as if just to prove a point:

* *He climbs up a ladder, down the ladder, moves the ladder ...* Get some kind of moving platform; a tricycle?
* *For every hole, he puts his drill away, picks up the yardstick and measures another 30 centimeters on the ceiling.* There are known, simple and effective methods to create many markings at a given interval in a straight line, all in one go.
* *For every hole, the worker picks up his drill, extends it in an awkward position with his right [biceps](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biceps) as the main support, lifts it up to the ceiling, and drills a hole.* Combine the platform in bullet one with a body support platform for the drill, letting the worker use his strongest muscles, the legs, to do most of the work. Some old-fashioned pneumatics or hydraulics may also help.

The above should also cut the robot's speed-lead by a factor of about two.

All of this is low tech. Robotics may be the future, but the above should have been the past and present. "We make boring exciting," nLink states in a trademarked slogan. Watching a robot drill holes after holes after holes in the ceiling will eventually lose its virgin thrill.
