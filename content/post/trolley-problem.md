**If the self-driving car from Google has two self-driving cars between itself and the cliff: What car does it decide to crash into?**

The car from Google or the car from Apple?

It's in a brilliant article on [Medium.com](https://medium.com/@tanayj/self-driving-cars-and-the-trolley-problem-5363b86cb82d) Tanay Jaipuria outlines what he calls the "Self-driving cars and the Trolley problem." The "Trolley Problem" is, in short, a trolley going wild down a railway track; leaving the situation as is kills five people to the left, pulling the lever next to you kills one person to the right; what do you do?

At the core of the discussion about robotics and artificial intelligence has, since Isaac Asimov's three laws of robotics in 1942, been: What if they decide to turn against us?

>But can you imagine a world in which say Google or Apple places a value on each of our lives, which could be used at any moment of time to turn a car into us to save others? Would you be okay with that?<cite>Tanay Jaipuria</cite>

The above may be scary enough, but at least it supposes that these giant companies are in the business for the utilitarianism, that their motives are noble. 

If Google and Apple applies Herbert Spencer's theory of ["Survival of the fittest"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_of_the_fittest) to robotics, the world may look different: 

**Driving that Apple off the cliff would move the Googlebots one step closer to survival -- to winning.**
