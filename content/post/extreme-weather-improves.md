**"This product may not look so good now, but wait a couple of years, let the boiling sun and the stormy weather polish it with some brutal beating!"**

"Then!" says the salesman, high pitched and eager: "Then the real beauty will shine!"
 
The creator of mankind was the last one to take this design approach seriously: "I created you on the pale side to leave plenty of room for the sun to make you tanned and beautiful!"

And then the nature was filled with incredibly beautiful, weathery structures, like this snapshot from the Canyonlands National Park.

In the world of commercial product design, however, it gets ugly fast.

A quick glance at the illustrated menu in front of the beach restaurant: The product design for *that ink* and *that paper* had taken a wrong turn.

**The colours are all washed out, the food far from fresh.**
	
"We must protect it from the sun so it doesn't get destroyed so fast," was the industrial designer's first thought.

This is an approach that *feels* natural. But the end result will always be mediocre. 

Some of these products are built as fashion statements, and yes, the umbrella and the sun glasses may look good, but they won't improve when exposed to the rain and the sun rays they were built for.

Many tourist products are built so people can enjoy the sun while using them. There are very few ski resorts in the shadow of the hill, but it's not like the foundation product -- the snow to ski on -- gets any better as the sun melts it and the rain wets it. 

## Work With Weather

Why not strive for a product that improves from a hard, weathery[^weathering] beating?
 
Cindy McComb, a materials engineer working for the car manufacuterer Ford, uses the word "weathering" when she talks about the materials in Ford F150:

-- The best material for weathering and impact is acrylic material. The part we're testing is a molded acrylic material that won't peel, won't fade. Really, the best part of acrylic is it has good characteristics for sunload, she says.[^fordf150] 

**"It won’t peel, won’t fade". That would make a great marketing slogan.**

3M is maybe best known for their bonding tape. _Weathering_ is an important topic on their website:

>Customers can expect our traffic safety materials, signage, and other products to perform reliably after years of brutal exposure to the weather.<cite>3M Solutions[^3mweathering]</cite>

"Perform reliably" is of course good, but wouldn't it be even better if the products' performance *improved after years of exposure to the weather*?

## Weathering Steel

There are real examples of product designs that tries to implement parts of this idea. One example is *Weathering steel:*

>Weathering steel, best-known under the trademark COR-TEN steel and sometimes written without the hyphen as "Corten steel", is a group of steel alloys which were developed to eliminate the need for painting, and form a stable rust-like appearance if exposed to the weather for several years.<cite>Wikipedia[^weatheringsteel]</cite>

This isn't a new product. The 64-story skyscraper U.S. Steel Tower in downtown Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, was completed in 1971 and pioneered this construction technique.[^steeltower]

This is still mostly about protection. Rusty steel has its problems: The beauty of it is in the eye of the beholder, and rust doesn't look *that* good when rubbed onto your clothes. 

Steel is prettiest when it *looks like steel*. What about a steel alloy that looks like steel when new, but *even more steely* after some decades in the sun and the rain?

## Is it Practical?

All of this sounds good on paper, but may well be hushed away as abstract thinking with no practical appliances. Making house paint that gets more vivid colours after years in the sun may be a though task, but is a more uplifting approach than *making paint that doesn't peel and fade so fast*.

And without that mindset, it will never happen.
