**Tourists flow into the post war reconstructed towns of Europe to admire the classical architecture, after which they return home to their blocky and ugly houses.**

<!--more-->

The entire Castle district area in Budapest is part of the UNESCO World Heritage Sights. The architecture in Budapest is a blend of many; gothic, renaissance, ottoman, baroque, classicism, romantic, art nouveau ...[^budapest-architecture]

And then there is the Hilton hotel.

The façade doesn't look too bad, and fits nicely into the surroundings.

And façade it is. 2-3 meters of it. Behind it is glass and ugly structures.

And it doesn't get prettier bending into a 13th-century cloister from both sides.

But there is hope. 100 meters away from the dreadful Hilton, at the edge of Castle Hill, is a newly built classicist-style villa, with elegant plasterwork in the façade, all class. It looks expensive, but shouldn't need to be.

The blocky building constructions from the Brutalist architecture[^brutalist] is wide-spread, considered a cheap way to provide housing for the masses. The classical architecture's complex shapes, ornaments and plasterwork may have been more costly and manual labor intensive. But the recent technology advances must have improved this situation? Creating 3D copies of architectural details with laser technology should be a trivial task in 2015.

**So if presented with both a beautiful and classical house and a blocky modern box, both with approximately the same price tag; which one would you choose?**

If not for the masses yet, some people have caught on to this. Wikipedia names this movement "New Classical architecture".[^new-classical] 

>New Classical architecture is a contemporary movement in architecture that continues the practice of classical, historicist and traditional architecture, that never ceased during the twentieth century, even as modernist styles became more dominant.<cite>Wikipedia</cite>

But most of the examples in the wild are big public buildings, as in the image below, the Schermerhorn Symphony Center in Nashville, Tennessee -- opened in 2006.

But there are exceptions. The picture below shows the Richmond Riverside in London, built in the mid 1980s, architected by *Quinlan and Francis Terry Architects*.[^quinland-francis] Quinlan Terry was awarded the "Terry Driehaus Prize for New Classical Architecture" for this project.[^driehaus]

**Would you rather live there or in the Brutalist architectured alternative below?**[^brutalist]
